# bare-metal-drivers-for-STM32

The repository following the course "(MCU1) Learn bare metal driver development using Embedded C: Writing drivers for STM32 GPIO,I2C,SPI,USART from scratch" on Udemy to practicing driver development of STM32 Microcontroller.

- Course Main Topics: GPIO, GPIO Interrupt, I2C, SPI, UART and USART driver APIs

- IDE: STM32CubeIDE 1.18.1 

- Microcontroller: STM32 NUCLEO-F767ZI
